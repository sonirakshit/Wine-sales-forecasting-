# Wine-sales-forecasting-
1. Developed a Time series forecasting model using ARIMA and SARIMAX to forecast the future sales of wine.
2. Created as a proof of concept and the aim is to estimate the sales and efficiently allocate the resources.
3. Used Augumented Dickey-Fuller Test to check the stationarity of the time series data.
4. Used PACF and ACF plots to indentify p and q values for AR and MA.
